    "Lasso regularization is a method used to address the problem of overfitting in regression models by adding a penalty term to the cost function. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients multiplied by a hyperparameter (λ).\n",

    "Regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the cost function that reduces the size of the regression coefficients. This helps to prevent the model from being too complex and overfitting the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new data.\n",

    "For example, consider a linear regression problem where we are trying to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and location. If we have a large data set with many features, it is possible that some of the features may not be relevant to the price of the house and may introduce noise into the model.
